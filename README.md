# Herodotus

This repository was created during my participation in the Makeathon competition organized by UniAI. It pertains to NOVA's challenge, which requested the development of a tool capable of generating knowledge from public sources.

## Our Solution

**Herodotus** is a knowledge-generation tool that gathers data from Greek newspaper news reports and correlates it with NOVA, as well as the employee using it, to produce useful information for the user.
